        <h1>Shawn's CRUD App</h1>
        <p>The mobile app I have been working on for several months now has a specific purpose with a specific client. The app is called a "Pre-Brief / De-Brief Sheet" and it is used by individuals who have studied sales techniques at the Sales College of Northwest Ohio. With a "Pre-Brief / De-Brief Sheet" one would take specific notes about their client. This helps the salesperson understand the learning style and values of the client so that they can better achieve <em>Authentic Communitcation</em>.</p>

	  <div class="modal-body">
	    <p>According to PhoneGap it appears most of the phone features are available for both platforms, at least for the new versions of iOS.</p>
	    <p>My CRUD app is a very specific form tool for a sales training class that I have taken. It basically helps a sales rep to "profile" a client and save these values. For my app, I would like to make it link to a user's Contact information (why make them duplicate info you already have saved about the client?) The second would be the camera, as a tool for the app the camera could be used, not only to photo the client, but to photo their environment.</p>
	    <p>Workflow... I have learned that planning is definitely important, especially when doing class and working full time. For me, workflow means to layout the idea for the app and see what it is that I intend for it to do, first. I prefer to have the background structure put together and make the app function next, then to deal with beautifying it last.</p>
	    <p>As of yet I don't have any clear intentions for the Demo App, I will be starting on that this afternoon. For my revised version of the CRUD app, A) make it fully functional. B) Add the new features, have the app connect directly to the contacts already on the phone and offer a place to take photos and pull them back up within the app.</p>

	    <p><em>1. What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</em> Clean code with concise tags would be a good start. This is the first I have even considered such things as they have not been discussed in any previous classes. This idea definitely makes me want to pay better attention to how I write my code, especially for regular websites and such.</p>
	    <p><em>2. Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</em>In my research I found that the current use of AJAX can cause issues for screen readers. AJAX can cause dynamic changes to the web page without a page refresh, while the popular screen readers buffer the DOM when loading the page and therefore won't always register the changes brought about by the AJAX elements. Other common problems result from poorly written code and lack of using descriptive tags that help the screen reader recognize elements or give more information to the listener.</p>
	    <p><em>3. Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</em>The DrawBraille is a smartphone whereas the "touch screen" is a braille face that move the dots up or down to "display" different words. The lower portion then allows the user to type in braille as well. It claims to be a full featured smartphone with many of the same abilities as the iPhone. Macs and the iPad come with a feature, provided by Apple, called VoiceOver. It allows " gesture support, braille display mirroring, web spots, and spoken hints. It also offers frequently requested features including autospeaking web pages, “read all,” web page summary, web table support, user-created labels, customizable verbosity, and more." While I haven't tried it out myself it looks very cool. I didn't even know it was there until researching this post.</p>
	    <p><em>4. Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</em>The app Mobile Accessibility for Android looks like it does it all. Making most of the basic smartphone features accessible through speach and read-back. It works with Phone, Contacts, SMS, Alarms, Web, Calender, Email, Where Am I?, Apps and Settings. Another app IDEAL Item Identifier allows the reading of barcodes then looks up the item and reads to the user what the item is, helping the blind function in stores.</p>

	  <div class="modal-body">
	    <p><em>1. What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</em>The top U.S. categories for FREE apps: Games, Communication, Tools, Social, Entertainment. The top U.S. categories for PAID apps: Games, Photography, Tools, Music and Audio, Personalization.</p>
		<p><em>2. What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?</em>In Japan the top categories for FREE apps break down to: Games, Tools, Communication, Social, Media and Video. In Japan the top categories for PAID apps break down to: Games, Photography, Health and Fitness, Tools, Personalization.</p>
		<p><em>3. What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</em>For Great Britain the top FREE app categories are: Games, Communication, Tools, Social, Media and Video. For Great Britain the top PAID app categories are: Games, Photography, Tools, Music and Audio, and Personalization.</p>
		<p><em>3. Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</em> Everyone, at least in our three demographics, loves games, cameras and photography and multiple forms of communications in their pockets.</p>
		<p><em>4. What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S? in Japan? in Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?</em> The best statistic I could find for this is a total of 4% of Android users have 4.0, the vast majority of Android users are using version 2.3. At present time a developer would want to build for Android 2.3 in order to catch over 60% of the Android market. If one were to develop specifically for Android 4.0 they may implement features or code that would not be available to the masses, therefore greatly limiting adoption of their app.</p>
		<p><em>5. What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</em> According to xandroidtablets.com the U.S. is the most expensive at about $42 per 2GB of mobile data, Great Britain comes in at about $24 for the same 2GB, and Japan is the best value at about $12 per 2GB. While there is talk of data caps, as of this writing it seems all countries offer unlimited data options. For the best functionality of the app we will be developing we would want it to be as lean as possible for several reasons, but in the U.S. especially we want it to access the mobile internet as little as possible to save the user's bandwidth.</p>
		<p><em>6. And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</em> Well, the obvious first choice would be a game of some sort. Short, level-based, easy to pause and return to later so it can be played during commutes and in line at the store. My personal thoughts would be to integrate a game such as this with some form of social networking. Something you can play quickly, post your scores and taunt your friends. This will keep people interested as they are not only trying to beat the game itself, but they are out to do better than their buddy.</p>
